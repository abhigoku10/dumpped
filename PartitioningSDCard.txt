NOTE:: Check for the Hardware lock in the SD card adapter. if it is lock one cannot perform write operation on it
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step1: Insert SD card on the laptop using SD card adapter.

Step2: Run "lsblk" on terminal to check the device name and path.

Step3: First Unmount the device 

Step4: Run lsblk again on terminal.
 	memory card will have a name. For eg. mmcblk0/1, sdb,sdc ..etc.

Step5: after inserting the card, it is not mounted follow these steps:
	Step1: insert card
	Step2: open terminal and run sudo fdisk -l
	Step3: Check the name of SD card[Eg: /dev/mmcblk0, /dev/sdb/ /dev/sdc]
	Step4: mkdir /mnt/SD
	Step5: mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/SD
	Step6: if step5 gives error; try mount -t ext3 /dev/sdc1 /mnt/SD

Step6: sudo fdsik <path of the sd card>  #Not the partition path
	E.g.     /dev/mmcblk0 -> path of the whole SD card.
     		/dev/mmcblk0p1 or /dev/mmcblk0p2 -> path of the SD card partition p1 and p2.
     		instead of mmcblk0 it can be sdb or sdc.

Step7:Commands:
	m for help
	p for list for patition
	d for deleting the partitions.
	u for changning the units from sectors to cyclinder.
	n for creating the new partiton.
	t for creating the type of filesystem partition.

Step8: Delete all partitions using the following commands
	Command (m for help): d

Step9: Give the partition number you want to delete 1/2.

Step10: Press 'u' to change the unit to cylinder.
	Command (m for help): u
Step11:	Creating new partitions: Press n
	Command (m for help): n
	[ Command action
	  e extended
	  p primary partition (1-4) ]

Step12: Press p to create a primary partition. enter the following values
	p
	Give partition number:Partition number (1-4): 1
	First cylinder (1-1038, default 1): Press Enter
	Last cylinder, +cylinders or +size{K,M,G} (1-1038, default 1038): +100M 

Step13: Press p to create a primary partition. enter the following values
	p
	Give partition number:Partition number (1-4): 1
	First cylinder (1-1038, default 1): Press Enter
	Last cylinder, +cylinders or +size{K,M,G} (1-1038, default 1038): Press Enter 

Step14: Assign file system to created partitions. Partition 1 as FAT16 and partition 2 as LINUX.
	Command (m for help): t
	Partition number (1-4): 1
	Hex code (type L to list codes): 6
	Changed system type of partition 1 to 6 (FAT16)
	Command (m for help): t
	Partition number (1-4): 2
	Hex code (type L to list codes): 83

Step15: Press p to list all the partition

Step16: Now the partitions are created as above. Save these changes by pressing 'w'.
	Command (m for help): w

Step17: Again make sure both the partitions are unmounted.
	umount <path of the first partition> 
	umount <path of second partition>

Step18: Now format both the partitions. Partition 1 as VFAT (windows) partition and 2nd partition as EXT3 (Linux).
	sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1
	sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb2
 	Now SD card is ready to use.
	Remove the SD card and insert again then the respective partitions can be viewed by the below command.
	mount
